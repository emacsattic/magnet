{"name":"magnet.el","body":"The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent\r\ndata are not consistent across Emacs packages.  This isn't just a\r\nproblem with third-party packages but even with built-in packages.\r\n\r\nSome packages put these files directly in `user-emacs-directory` or\r\n`$HOME` or in a subdirectory of either of the two or elsewhere.\r\nFurthermore sometimes file names are used that don't provide any\r\ninsight into what mode might have created them.\r\n\r\nThis package sets out to fixes this by changing the values of path\r\nvariables to put files in either `magnet-etc-directory` or\r\n`magnet-var-directory`, using subdirectories when appropriate and\r\ndescriptive file names.  In a way this is similar to a color-theme -\r\na path-theme if you will.  Except that there is no way to unload it -\r\nthat wouldn't make any sense.\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis is work in progress and very incomplete at the moment.  Only very\r\nfew packages have been themed so far.  Eventually all built-in and many\r\npopular third-party packages should be themed.\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-release.  Version numbers are inspired by how Emacs\r\nis versioned.  `1.1.0` will be the first stable version theming an\r\nacceptable number of packages.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\nPlease send me pull request with your additions and corrections:\r\nhttps://github.com/tarsius/magnet/pulls\r\n\r\nFor a list of people who have contributed see:\r\nhttps://github.com/tarsius/magnet/graphs/contributors\r\n","tagline":"for Emacs configuration and persistent files","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
