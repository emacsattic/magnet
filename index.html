        <p>The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent
data are not consistent across Emacs packages.  This isn't just a
problem with third-party packages but even with built-in packages.</p>

<p>Some packages put these files directly in <code>user-emacs-directory</code> or
<code>$HOME</code> or in a subdirectory of either of the two or elsewhere.
Furthermore sometimes file names are used that don't provide any
insight into what mode might have created them.</p>

<p>This package sets out to fixes this by changing the values of path
variables to put files in either <code>magnet-etc-directory</code> or
<code>magnet-var-directory</code>, using subdirectories when appropriate and
descriptive file names.  In a way this is similar to a color-theme -
a path-theme if you will.  Except that there is no way to unload it -
that wouldn't make any sense.</p>

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>This is work in progress and very incomplete at the moment.  Only very
few packages have been themed so far.  Eventually all built-in and many
popular third-party packages should be themed.</p>

<p>This is a pre-release.  Version numbers are inspired by how Emacs
is versioned.  <code>1.1.0</code> will be the first stable version theming an
acceptable number of packages.</p>
